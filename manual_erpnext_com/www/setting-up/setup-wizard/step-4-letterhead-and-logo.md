### Letterhead

A letterhead is the heading at the top of a sheet of letter paper (stationery). That heading usually consists of a name and an address, and a logo or corporate design, and sometimes a background pattern. The term "letterhead" is often used to refer to the whole sheet imprinted with such a heading.

Click on the box ‘Attach Letterhead’ . Select the image file from the place it is stored and click enter.

You may choose to skip this step if your letterhead is not ready.

To select letterhead later through the setup module, read [Letter-head](/setting-up/letter-head)


#### To "attach as web-link"

If you wish to select the letterhead which is stored as a weblink, you can select that letterhead by clicking on “attach as web-link”.

### Logo

A logo is a graphic mark or emblem commonly used by commercial enterprises, organizations and even individuals to aid and promote instant public recognition. Logos are either purely graphic (symbols/icons) or are composed of the name of the organization

To attach a logo in the setup wizard click on the box “Attach Logo”. Select your picture and enter.
