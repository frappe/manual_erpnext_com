# Day 1: Set up Customer, Item and Supplier

<p class="lead"> To begin using ERPNext it is essential to set up a few pages of Customers, Items and Suppliers.</p>

### Customer

Fill the Item form. An Item is your company's product or a service. The term
Item is applicable to your core products as well as your raw materials. It can
be a product or service that you buy/sell from your Customers/Suppliers.

Filling Item details is an important step in ERPNext. Do not postpone this
step. After clicking on Item, make a new Item.

> Note: This form will not be saved if Warehouse details are not entered.

To understand how to fill an Item in detail, visit [Item](/stock/item-master). Add 5 Item records to ERPnext. After adding these records, go back to the Setup Page and add Suppliers.

  
### Suppliers

To create Suppliers, go to the main menu and click on Buying module. Then click on the icon Supplier.

> Buying > Supplier > New Supplier
