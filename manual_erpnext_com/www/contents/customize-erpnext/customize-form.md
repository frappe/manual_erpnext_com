####Step 3:Edit Property

On selecting Doctype/table, you will have all the fields of the table updated as rows in the Customize Form table. You should drill down to field you need to work on, Project Name in this case.

On clicking Project Name row, fields to set various property for this field will be shown. To Customize the mandatory property for a field, there is a field called "Mandatory". Checking this field will set Project Name field as mandatory in the Quotation form.

Like this, you can customize following properties of the field.

* Change field types (for e.g. you want to increase the number of decimal places, you can convert come fields from Float to Currency).
* Change labels to suit your industry / language.
* Make certain fields mandatory.
* Hide certain fields.
* Change layout (sequence of fields). To do this, select a field in the grid and click on“Up” or “Down” in the grid toolbar.
* Add / edit “Select” Options. (for example, you can add more sources in Leads etc).

####Step 4: Update
