### Best Practice: Lean Manufacturing

The state of art manufacturing philosophy (the rationale behind the planning
processes) comes from Japanese auto major Toyota. At the time when American
manufacturers depended on MRP systems to plan their manufacturing based on
their sales forecasts, they turned around the problem by discovering a leaner
way of planning their production. They realized that:

The biggest cause of wastage in manufacturing is variation (in product and
quantity).

So they standardized their products and sub-assemblies and sold fixed
quantities based on what they produced or did not produce based on what they
sold. This way, they had an extremely predictable and stable product mix. If
they sold less than planned, they would simply stop production.

Their card signaling system kanban, would notify all their suppliers to stop
production too. Hence they never used any of the complex material planning
tools like MRP to play day-to-day material requirements, but a simple
signaling system that said either STOP or GO.

They combined this system with neatly managed factories with well labeled
racks.

Small manufacturing companies are usually make-to-order or engineer-to-order
and can hardly afford to have a high level of standardization. Thus small
manufacturing businesses should aim for repeatability by innovating processes
and creating a common platform for products.
