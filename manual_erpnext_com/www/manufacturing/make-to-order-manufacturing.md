Make-to-order is a manufacturing process in which manufacturing starts only
after a customer's order is received.

The company has some standard items but the product is only made when the
customer places an order. This is true for furniture, for designer gift items
etc.

Manufacturing after receiving customer's orders means to start a pull-type
supply chain operation because manufacturing is performed when demand is
confirmed, i.e. being pulled by demand.

In this type of manufacturing, production orders are linked to one or more
sales orders.

In ERPNext, to follow Make-To-Order type of manufacturing, you can make
Production Orders directly from Sales Orders or from Production Planning Tool
( Material Resource Planning).  Visit [Production Planning Tool](/manufacturing/production-planning-tool) to understand in detail, how to make Production Orders.

Go to the Manufacturing Module to check your Production Order. Manually check
the Production Order and Submit the Order. After submitting, click on the
Action button, to get a drop-down list. Select Transfer Raw Material.
